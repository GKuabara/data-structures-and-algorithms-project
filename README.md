# data-structures-and-algorithms-project
University project regarding data structures and algorithms

This project is just a simple googlebot. We use a csv text with a list of websites as in input to a linked list. The parameters are the key of the website, its name, relevance, URL, and keywords related to the site. Then, we can manipule this data through 5 commands.

1 - Add a website

2 - Remove a website

3 - Add a keyword to a site, passing its key to do the access

4 - Chance relevance of a site, passing its key to do the access

5 - Exit the program
